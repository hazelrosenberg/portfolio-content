            Luxury fashion comes from designers and labels associated with high levels of quality, exclusivity, and price.
            As sneakers have made their way to the forefront of modern fashion, luxury brands have responded with premium, innovative, and sophisticated styles.
            Sam Lobban, senior vice president of designer and new concepts at Nordstrom, identifies two major categories in wich designer sneakers fall into: classic and fashion-forward.
            Classics, according to Loban, are, "iconic sneaker styles that have been updated with elevated fabrication, construcion and design details."
            Opposed to, "the more fashion-forward concepts in terms of innovation and design."
            The former tends to have a stronger focus on comfort and luxury materials, whereas the latter is more concerned with aesthetics.
            The following are some examples of luxury designer sneakers.
